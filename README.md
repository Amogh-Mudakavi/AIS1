## Introduction

Aerial imagery segmentation is crucial for various applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. This project leverages the U-Net architecture to achieve precise segmentation results.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

-   Python (>=3.6)
-   TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib
-   etc.

Install dependencies using:


`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository:
  
    
    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aerial-imagery-segmentation.git
    cd aerial-imagery-segmentation` 
    
2.  Follow the steps in the Usage Guide for detailed instructions on running the code.
    

## Dataset

Download the aerial imagery dataset from [source link] and organize it in the `data` directory. Ensure the dataset includes annotated masks for segmentation.

## Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to resize and normalize images:



`python preprocess.py` 

## Training

Train the U-Net model on the prepared dataset:



`python train.py` 

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model on test data and visualize results:


`python evaluate.py`
