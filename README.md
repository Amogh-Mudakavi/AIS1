# Aerial_Imagery_Segmentation
Implemented aerial imagery segmentation using U-Net, a convolutional neural network architecture. Gathered and preprocessed a dataset of aerial images with corresponding masks. Trained the model to effectively segment objects in the images, leveraging the U-Net's encoder-decoder structure with skip connections
